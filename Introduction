The project ‘Cricket Lovers’ is going to unite all the players who love to play cricket and miss playing that as they are far from their home countries. Project will mainly focus on those who are immensely interested in cricket and want to play it in Canada, because when we love something then location doesn’t matter. As we know that in Canada soccer is the main focused game and Cricket is not played. However, there are many people from different countries such as India and Pakistan who love to play cricket, but they do not get much chance to play it because being new here they do not have many people in their contact. This project will address the issue, helping people building up the contacts and uniting them. Furthermore, project will also discuss functional and non-functional requirements as well.
