The project is focused on the cricket lovers and this use-case diagram is for the same. As it can be seen in the use-case diagram the actor is the player. Firstly, the player will be asked to log in and then the system will verify the password, this explains an include relationship. If in case the password or the username is incorrect, then application will show an error and it will not proceed. In the next step it will ask for the availability in which the player will be asked to give his/her availability on which days they are free to play the game. Once all this is done, then they will be asked to submit an entry fee, this will allow them to be a part of the team. At the time of the payment, they will be asked that how they want to pay, which means from credit or from debit. Then this transaction will be monitored by the accountant. Once the payment is confirmed then application will ask for the previous records and the age group as well. The age is asked to assign them the teams according to their age group. Also, once the payment has been confirmed then the schedule will be provided by the scheduler. Another role of the accountant is to calculate the scores of the teams and put them in the display of the application. The player who has performed well will also get the awards in the form of cash and that same thing will also be under the control of the accountant. Once the availability has been given and the schedule has been confirmed then player will be asked to give the final confirmation of the match. There will also be the role of the system, who will provide the players with the equipment they need to play the game and other role of the system is to create the team as well.
